#Simon-Game

  Simon Game is a classic memory game where players have to repeat a sequence of colors in the same order that they were displayed. This is a browser-based version of the game, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

#Game Rules
  The game has four colored buttons, each producing a particular tone when pressed or activated by the game. A round in the game consists of the game lighting up one or more buttons in a random order, after which the player must reproduce that order by pressing the buttons. As the game progresses, the number of buttons to be pressed increases.

#How to Play
  To play the game, simply clone the repository or download the ZIP file and open index.html in your browser. Click the Start button to begin the game. The game will start with a sequence of one color. Your task is to repeat the sequence by clicking on the colored buttons in the same order. Each time you get the sequence right, the game will add another color to the sequence. If you get the sequence wrong, the game will end and you will have to start over.

#Features
  Simple and intuitive interface
  Randomly generated sequence of colors
  Sounds and visual feedback for button clicks
  Game over sound and animation
  Strict mode option (restarts the game if you make a mistake)
